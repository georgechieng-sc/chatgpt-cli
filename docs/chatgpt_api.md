### Documentation

https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create

### CURLS

Request:

```shell
curl --location --insecure --request POST 'https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions' \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENAI_API_KEY}" \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
     "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
     "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the OpenAI mission?"}],
     "stream": false
  }' | jq .
```

Response:

```json
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-7BQnIwmXhD6ohmwS6BjRHJrw9rJ7K",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "created": 1682958960,
  "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0301",
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 15,
    "completion_tokens": 96,
    "total_tokens": 111
  },
  "choices": [
    {
      "message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The OpenAI mission is to create and develop advanced Artificial Intelligence in a way that is safe and beneficial to humanity. Their goal is to build systems capable of performing tasks that would normally require human intelligence, such as natural language processing, understanding, and decision-making.

      },
      "finish_reason": "stop",
      "index": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

Or flip `stream` to `true` (this results in retrieving a ton of `jsonl`).

```shell
curl --location --insecure --request POST 'https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions' \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENAI_API_KEY}" \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
     "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
     "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the OpenAI mission?"}],
     "stream": true
  }'
```

```shell

data: [DONE]
```

### Uploading images

You can upload base64 encoded images from your local machine (and some models also accept URLs) using:

```shell
curl --location --insecure --request POST 'https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions' \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENAI_API_KEY}" \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data-raw '{
       "model": "gpt-4o",
       "messages": [
         {"role": "user", "content": "What is this image"},
         { "role": "user", "content": [
             {
               "type": "image_url",
               "image_url": {
                 "url": "data:image/png;base64,'"$(base64 -i ~/Downloads/wifi2.png)"'"
               }
             }
           ]
         }
       ],
       "stream": false
    }' | jq .
```

Note that some models also allow the use of URLs

```shell
curl --location --insecure --request POST 'https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions' \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENAI_API_KEY}" \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data-raw '{
       "model": "gpt-4o",
       "messages": [
         {"role": "user", "content": "What is this image"},
         { "role": "user", "content": [
             {
               "type": "image_url",
               "image_url": {
                 "url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Imagen_de_los_canales_conc%C3%A9ntricos_en_%C3%81msterdam.png"
               }
             }
           ]
         }
       ],
       "stream": false
    }' | jq .
```

### Using functions

1. User Query → OpenAI API
2. OpenAI API → Function Call (local machine)
3. Function Call → External Function
4. External Function → Function Response
5. Function Response → OpenAI API
6. OpenAI API → Final Response to User

```shell
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
-d '{
  "model": "gpt-4",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "What is the weather like in Paris today?"
    }
  ],
  "tools": [
    {
      "type": "function",
      "function": {
        "name": "get_weather",
        "description": "Get current temperature for a given location.",
        "parameters": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "location": {
              "type": "string",
              "description": "City and country e.g. Bogotá, Colombia"
            }
          },
          "required": ["location"]
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "tool_choice": {
    "type": "function",
    "function": {"name": "get_weather"}
  }
}'
```

### Providing custom context

You can provide your own context in the messages array in your callout. You can split this data over multiple lines. For
example

```json
[
  {
    "role": "system",
    "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
  },
  {
    "role": "user",
    "content": "My dog's name is Piet Kernbom"
  },
  {
    "role": "user",
    "content": "and he's a 3-year-old Golden Retriever. He loves playing fetch and going for long walks."
  }
]
```

Using the chatgpt-cli with this context:

```shell
./bin/chatgpt What kind of toys would be best for Piet Kernbom?
Golden Retrievers like Piet Kernbom typically enjoy playing with toys that can be used for interactive play and also provide mental stimulation. Some good options for him may include:

1. Tennis Balls: Since Piet loves playing fetch, tennis balls can be great for him as they can be thrown over long distances.

2. Rope Toys: Rope toys are great for interactive play and also help with dental health. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes that Piet can choose from.

3. Puzzle Toys: Puzzle toys like treat balls are great for providing mental stimulation and keeping Piet entertained while you're away.

4. Soft Toys: Soft toys make great comfort toys for Golden Retrievers and can provide them with a sense of security.

Overall, it's good to keep a variety of toys on hand and observe your dog's preferences to find out what he likes best.
```

    }
  ]
}
```

### Train (fine-tune) OpenAI models with custom data

1. Create a `jsonl` training file and call it `mydata.jsonl`

```json lines
{
  "prompt": "Who is Piet Kernbom?'",
  "completion": "Piet Kernbom was a famous baseball player for the Yankees"
}
{
  "prompt": "Where was Piet Kernbom from?",
  "completion": "He is from Suriname."
}
{
  "prompt": "What are some of Piet Kernbom his hobbies",
  "completion": "Magic tricks and cooking."
}
```

2. Upload the `jsonl` training file. Run this `curl` from the same directory the file is located in.

```shell
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/files \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENAI_API_KEY}" \
  -F purpose="fine-tune" \
  -F file="@mydata.jsonl"
```

Output:

```json
{
  "object": "file",
  "id": "file-cj5IFUAN43k3BHd1qRd4lcU2",
  "purpose": "fine-tune",
  "filename": "mydata.jsonl",
  "bytes": 291,
  "created_at": 1683300186,
  "status": "uploaded",
  "status_details": null
}
```

3. Create a "fine-tune" based on the uploaded file

```shell
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/fine-tunes \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENAI_API_KEY}" \
  -d '{
    "training_file": "file-cj5IFUAN43k3BHd1qRd4lcU2",
    "model": "davinci"
  }'
```

Output:

```json
{
  "object": "fine-tune",
  "id": "ft-SyQ7nzBdGJBVWtFD2rpVfQCp",
  "hyperparams": {
    "n_epochs": 4,
    "batch_size": null,
    "prompt_loss_weight": 0.01,
    "learning_rate_multiplier": null
  },
  "organization_id": "org-zgHnNxrmfCn3EoM43F5XHh2C",
  "model": "davinci",
  "training_files": [
    {
      "object": "file",
      "id": "file-cj5IFUAN43k3BHd1qRd4lcU2",
      "purpose": "fine-tune",
      "filename": "mydata.jsonl",
      "bytes": 291,
      "created_at": 1683300186,
      "status": "processed",
      "status_details": null
    }
  ],
  "validation_files": [],
  "result_files": [],
  "created_at": 1683300391,
  "updated_at": 1683300391,
  "status": "pending",
  "fine_tuned_model": null,
  "events": [
    {
      "object": "fine-tune-event",
      "level": "info",
      "message": "Created fine-tune: ft-SyQ7nzBdGJBVWtFD2rpVfQCp",
      "created_at": 1683300391
    }
  ]
}
```

4. Pull the "fine-tune" endpoint to retrieve the model ID. Once the status is "succeeded" you can curl the new model
   which identifier you can find under `fine_tuned_model`.

```shell
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/fine-tunes \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENAI_API_KEY}"
```

5. Hit the new model

```shell
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/completions   -H 'Content-Type: application/json'   -H "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENAI_API_KEY}"   -d '{
  "model": "davinci:ft-personal-2023-05-05-15-39-01",
  "prompt": "According to the data I trained on, for what team did Piet Kernbom play baseball?",
  "max_tokens": 10,
  "temperature": 0.2
}'
```

Output:

```json
{
  "id": "cmpl-7Cs7cr7GxXRYkD9YUc9DiXPPx6HJQ",
  "object": "text_completion",
  "created": 1683302336,
  "model": "davinci:ft-personal-2023-05-05-15-39-01",
  "choices": [
    {
      "text": "\n\nThe answer is the New York Yankees.",
      "index": 0,
      "logprobs": null,
      "finish_reason": "length"
    }
  ],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 19,
    "completion_tokens": 10,
    "total_tokens": 29
  }
}
```

Advanced algorithms, particularly deep learning models, are analyzing medical imaging data with impressive precision, augmenting radiologists' capabilities and enabling more personalized screening schedules based on individual risk factors. ([forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/11/14/ai-in-healthcare-a-new-era-of-personalized-patient-care/?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn mental health, AI systems are being developed to predict and plan treatments effectively. For instance, AI models have demonstrated higher diagnostic accuracy for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder compared to general practitioners in controlled studies. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_mental_health?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Operational Efficiency and AI Integration**\n\nHospitals worldwide are adopting AI to improve patient care and operational efficiency. The \"smart hospital\" market, incorporating AI, IoT, and robotics, is projected to grow to $148 billion by 2029. Implementations include AI systems that allow patients to control their environment via smartphones and predict sepsis risks, as well as the use of robots for surgeries and supply deliveries. ([ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/2805edfd-36db-4a58-b93f-411a18c6e003?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn India, Apollo Hospitals plans to increase its investment in AI to reduce the workload of medical staff by automating routine tasks like medical documentation. The goal is to free up two to three hours per day for healthcare professionals, addressing high nurse attrition rates and expanding bed capacity. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/indias-apollo-hospitals-bets-ai-tackle-staff-workload-2025-03-13/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Regulatory Developments**\n\nThe UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has introduced the AI Airlock, a regulatory sandbox designed to address challenges in regulating AI medical devices. This initiative aims to enhance the safe development and deployment of AI in healthcare by simulating regulatory processes, balancing innovation with patient safety. ([healthcareai.news](https://healthcareai.news/?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn the United States, the Paragon Health Institute has issued a report titled \"Healthcare AI Regulation: Guidelines for Maintaining Public Protections & Innovation.\" The report emphasizes the need for specific regulations that consider both the type of AI technology and the healthcare context, advocating for the use of existing regulatory agencies to govern AI in healthcare. ([medlatest.com](https://www.medlatest.com/device-news/ai-in-healthcare-new-report-into-regulation/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Challenges and Ethical Considerations**\n\nDespite these advancements, challenges persist. A study published in *Nature Medicine* reveals that AI models used in healthcare can exhibit biases based on patients' socioeconomic and demographic profiles, potentially altering treatments and diagnostics in ways that mirror real-world disparities. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/health-rounds-ai-can-have-medical-care-biases-too-study-reveals-2025-04-09/?utm_source=openai))\n\nAdditionally, the integration of AI nurses in hospitals has faced pushback from nursing unions. While AI nurses assist with tasks like patient monitoring and information provision, concerns have been raised about undermining nurses' expertise and degrading patient care quality, leading to debates about the role of AI in healthcare.
